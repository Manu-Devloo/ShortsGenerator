## Configuration

The program uses a `config.json` file with the following sections:

### API Configuration
- OpenAI API settings for content generation
- Text-to-speech voice selection

### Video Formatting
- Dimensions for short-form (vertical) and long-form (horizontal) videos
- Font settings for on-screen text

### File Paths
- Directories for background videos, temporary files, and output videos

### YouTube Settings
- Default tags for uploaded videos
- Privacy status setting
- Channel ID
- Default description - appended to all AI-generated descriptions

## Default Description Feature

The program automatically appends a default signature description to all AI-generated descriptions when uploading videos to YouTube. This helps maintain consistency in your video descriptions and can include:

- Call-to-action messages (subscribe, like, etc.)
- Channel branding
- Hashtags for better discoverability
- Contact information
- Copyright notices

To customize the default description, modify the `default_description` field in the `youtube` section of `config.json`:

```json
"youtube": {
  "default_description": "\n\nðŸ‘‹ Thanks for watching! Don't forget to like, subscribe, and hit the notification bell for more content like this!\n\n#shorts #viral #trending"
}
```
